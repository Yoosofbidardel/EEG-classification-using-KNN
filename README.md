# EEG-classification-using-KNN

the aim of this project is to detect whether the data is AA or AAV  and we have a precise approach.

the algorithm for choosing test and train data set is LOO(leave one out).

also, for extracting features we used eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

you can see the aa and AAV last sample for a better understanding

and we measured accuracy, F1score, recall, and precision
